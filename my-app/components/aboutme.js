          <h3>About Holden the Hitcher</h3>
          <p>
            Three years following my return to the States… I spent time making blog posts about my travels… without real
            intent to implement them professionally. Now, after increasing my knowledge of website development, my
            experiences can now take on a life of their own. You won’t believe the amount of adventure that can fit
            within two years; nor will you see better examples the giving nature of people to those who find themself in
            a less than ideal situation.
            <br/>
            Disclaimer: This is not your Average ‘travel blog’!
            <br/>
            This follows my journey
            through 20 countries in Europe with nothing but a backpack and intentions, learning about different
            cultures, the people embodying them, and myself in the process. Stories also include volunteering on farms,
            homes, and hostels, along with some culinary facts and insights that may be foreign… or really hit close
            home with you. There is a favorite gear page for some of the tools I used with wild and urban camping when I
            wanted a place to sleep in more novel locations. My site aims to be ADA compliant using keyboard functions
            only. Please refer to

            and I hope you learn something new today in an interesting way, from the experiences I’ve lived through.
